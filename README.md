# Micro-Reddit

> Let’s build Reddit. Well, maybe a very junior version of it called micro-reddit..

In this project we:

- Made a model for users.
- Made a model for posts.
- Made a model for comments.
- Made validations for their inputs.
- Made associations between the user, the post and the comment model.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rails
- SQLite3

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Usage

- Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/sjcco/micro-reddit`.
- In the terminal write `rails console`.
- To see existing users write `Users.all`.
- To create a new user write `User.new(username: Example_user_name, email: email@example.com, password: password_example)`.
- To save a user use `User.save`.
